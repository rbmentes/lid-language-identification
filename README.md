## ✨ Methods Implemented

### 1. CNN-Based Deep Learning Model
📓 Notebook: `notebooks/01_CNN_Method.ipynb`

- Trained across multiple epochs  
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

### 2. MFCC Feature-Based Approach
📓 Notebook: `notebooks/02_MFCC_Method.ipynb`

- Extracted MFCC speech features  
- Built classification pipeline  
- Compared results with CNN model  

---

## 📊 Results

Both approaches include:

✅ Epoch training logs  
✅ Accuracy percentages  
✅ Confusion Matrix evaluation
